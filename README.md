## 🎓 About

This project was completed as part of a Udemy course on advanced CSS and Sass, which allowed me to enhance my skills in building modern and responsive website using CSS Grid. Throughout the course, I learned how to implement advanced design techniques such as creating custom grids, working with CSS variables, and utilizing responsive design principles. Additionally, I also gained experience in optimizing website performance, improving code maintainability, and creating reusable components.
